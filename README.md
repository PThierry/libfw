files to support integrity checking, cryptographic interactions (the libfirmware itself doesn't include cryptographic implementation) and firmware related
helpers such as dual-bank support helpers functions.

## Dependencies

The libfirmware depends on:
- the EwoK libstd for basic types (inttypes implementation for embedded systems)
